= Compile Errors =

If you get compile errors with GWTx such as: "The method close() is undefined for the type `OutputStream`" or "Errors in
`'jar:file:/path/to/GWTx.jar!/com/googlecode/gwtx/java/io/emul/java/io/ByteArrayOutputStream.java'"` then odds are you need to put the GWTx.jar before the gwt-user.jar in your project's classpath.

See

= GWT 1.5 compatibility =

Q: Is GWTx compatible with GWT 1.5 ?
A: The 1.5.x development branch focus on GWT 1.5 compatibility. Future releases of GWTx will include in version scheme the GWT version it is related to.

= java.io.Serializable (GWTx for GWT 1.3)  =

Q: What does java.io.Serializable provided by GWTx do?
A: Nothing. It just lets a class that implements Serializable compile and run in web mode. *It does not replace GWT's IsSerializable interface and providers zero functionality.* Using Serializable and IsSerializable is helpful if you want to use Java serialization somehow on the server (eg: clustering) and send the same class to the client via GWT's RPC.
